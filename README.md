8 queens problem being solved by a Genetic Algorithm Optimization writen in Python

to initiate population object invoke the constructor in population.py  with the following parameters:
- population size
- max number of iterations (-1 for infinite iterations until solution is found)
- reproduction rate (number between 0 and 1)
- mutation rate (number between 0 and 1)

to run the algorithm call iterate() method from the population object
